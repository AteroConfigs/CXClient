## Building
    git clone https://github.com/chrissxyt/cxclient
Open eclipse with /path/to/cxclient/eclipse as the workspace, add a new Java
Project called "Client", export that project as a Runnable Jar File.
## Installing
Grab a build, extract the folder (usually called something like "cxclient_x.x")
into your ~/.minecraft/versions/ or %APPDATA%\\.minecraft\versions\, depending
on your OS. If you want to use your own build: replace the jar file inside the
folder (usually called something like "cxclient_x.x.jar") with your own one.
## Updating
We planned an updater and now it is technically easily possible, but...we won't
do it! There are reasons, you can find them [here](UPDATER.md). For pure
updating you can just replace the old JAR or put the new folder there.
